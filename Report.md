ENSF 692 Spring 2025 - Final Project
Calgary Community Crime Statistics Dataset Analysis

Authors: Jason Chiu and Jason Tieh

## Dataset Description

The program primarily uses the Calgary **Community Crime Statistics** Dataset [1], which provides detailed monthly crime statistics from 2018 to 2024. The dataset includes information such as crime count, crime category, year, month, and location by community. The final dataset when merged includes columns such as business count, median assessed value, sector, wards, population household; with additional columns created that include Crime per Capita 1000 or Community Crime MTD Total. The final multi-indexed dataframe is exported as an excel file and be be found under /data/calgary_crime_data.xlsx. A screenshot of the final dataframe is shown below:

## User Interface Input and Output Summary

### Input

Users interact with the program through a command-line interface (CLI) where they are prompted to:

1. Choose whether to view reference maps (sector, ward, community) [9][10].
2. Select the type of region: Sector, Ward, or Community.
3. Choose whether to view a reference table with available locations to choose from in the chosen region
4. Specify the exact name of the Sector, Ward, or Community.
5. Specify the year.

The user must enter a Sector, Ward, Community, and year that exists in the dataset. If there is an invalid input, the user is prompted for re-entry without terminating the program. The program is also designed to handle case-sensitive inputs or extra spaces. 

After printing out a general stats table for the chosen region and year, plots are generated and further prompting appears:

6. Choose whether or not to save the generated plot as a png into the /images folder repeating for all 4 plots
7. Choose whether to re-run the visualizer with different chosen location and year repeating steps 1-6
8. Choose whether to export dataframe as an excel file for separate viewing thereafter terminating the program

### Output

The program returns general statistics and data plots for the selected region and year, including:

- A text summary of basic descriptive statistics for the chosen region and year and how they compare to other locations
of the same location type 
- A bar chart of **crime count by category**. (A general line plot across all years in Calgary is shown for comparison)
along with a corresponding pivot table of the same data but by month printed into the console
- A bar chart of **monthly crime counts**. (A general line plot across all years in Calgary is shown for comparison)
- A scatter plot comparing **crime per capita vs median assessed value** with the location highlighted for better viewing.
- A scatter plot comparing **total crime count vs number of businesses** with the location highlighted for better viewing.

The user is also prompted whether to analyze another region or quit. Upon quitting, the program thanks the user.

## Specification Compliance

### Data Handling
More than 3 seperate datasets are merged into a large dataset. All data is pulled directly from the .csv file without modification. The crime dataset is merged with:
- The *Communities by Wards* dataset [2] to retrieve the wards and sector column in the dataset
- The *Calgary Business Licences* [3] dataset to retrieve a count of the number of businesses in a community
- The *Assessments by Community* [4] dataset to retrieve the median assessed value of a community
- and The 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2021 *Census by Community* and *Federal Census Population by Community* datasets [5],[6],[7],[8] are merged and extrapolated to get the population of each community for a specified year.


### Code Implementation
The program meets this requirement because:
1. A print_describe() function uses the describe() method to give statistics (count, mean, min, max, std. deviation, etc.) about the crime count, Crime per Capita 1000, Businesses Opened, and Median Assess Value
2. We added two or more columns to the main dataframe. We calculated the Crime per Capita (per 1000 residents) and summed the Business count for the community. 
3. A masking operation, groupby operation, pivot table, and aggregation computation was used for a subset of the data when creating plots. For example: A masking operation is used based on the location and year, a group by operation and aggregation computation was used to get the total crime count for each month.

```python
    subset = final_df[(final_df[location_type] == location) & (final_df['Year'] == year)]
    monthly_crime = subset.groupby('Month')['Crime Count'].sum().reset_index()
```
A Pivot table was also created to easily plot the total crime count per month for each year
```python
    crime_month = final_df.groupby(['Year', 'Month'])['Crime Count'].sum().reset_index()
    pivot_table = crime_month.pivot(index='Month', columns='Year', values='Crime Count')
```
### User Interface and Execution
The program meets this requirement because the user enters atleast two required input values. The region type, the location, and the year. Invalid inputs are handled and prompted for re-entry. Screenshots are provided for the expected execution, including handling of incorrect input:

Plots are generated that depicts an aspect of the data. Screenshots of plots can be found in /screenshots. There are a total of four Plots, two examples are shown below:

![Example of Plot 1](screenshots/plot1.png)

![Example of Plot 2](screenshots/plot2.png)

### Commenting and Syntax
The program includes comments throughout the code for clarity. Classes, methods, and functions are documented using docstrings.  variables and functions are lowercase and seperated by underscore (e.g. get_location(), get_year()).
